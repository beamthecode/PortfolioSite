                              Growing up in a rural area I was naturally drawn to music, and it is to this day my biggest creative hobby.

                            I attended Columbia College in Columbia, MO. There I majored in Marketing, 
                            graduating with a Bachelors Degree in Business Administration.</p>

                            having accepted an accounts payable position. 
                            I have always had a mind that was both creative and analytical, so I was able to adapt to the accounting 
                            world with relative ease. I now have eight years of experience working in accounting.

                            Developing has always been of interest to me, as it is both a creative and analytical endeavor. 
                            I fell in love with the idea that we can create new applications that make our world easier. 
                            We can create platforms that people interact with. I love the idea that we can make life more
